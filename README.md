## About Me
I am a prospective PhD student with a keen interest in data-driven
control techniques for legged locomotion. Specifically, I am passionate
about developing hybrid model predictive control and reinforcement learning methods for safety-aware
online planning of adaptive locomotion.

Mechanical Engineering @ Imperial College London
Robotics Researcher @ Caltech
